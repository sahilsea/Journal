I really didn't wanna write today, because I am just so into watching series . First I finished , The Day of the Jackal , which was like 10hours , and now I am watching this lioness , which has two seasons in total , I feel really bad that I am not doing anything but just keep on watching. 

I need to go to college but I think , I don't want to think anything about it right now .
I feel really comfortable here at home that I just wanna be here.

There is not much to talk about for today, Other then the outstanding Series , the Day of the Jackal , I just love a character who is really smart and really knows what he is doing and where he is going , I love it when he really knows what he is doing .
