hello there, well the day 17 was full of procastination, so much , specially at night , it got really worse , I wasn't able to fall
asleep, watched reels all night. I slept around 3 o'clock . Was feeling really exaushted from all the dopamine depelation . I watched
a lot of IITian Baba reels , so much my head started spinning and so after that I kept on watching more and more, I tried to feel good
by hearing music , it worked for like 30 min and then after that it got worse, I just could'nt stop watching the reel .So now I have
decided to avoid going to social media as much as possible.

Well the college went well as usual , It was really cold that day too, and also I took shower so felt even colder .

Today it's much more Productive, took shower, washed clothes, took nap, got some coffee and started studying , covered all the topic
of OOP for my VB.NET exam ,happening the day after on Monday, watched very little reels , I feel good today , would like to keep it
going.
