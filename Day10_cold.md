Woke up like usual from the Baba's Bhajan Alarm from the almighty Loudspeaker, at 5:30 AM again slept till 8:00 AM . 
It was really cold this night , but even then I took shower , I was already being late so I tried to heat the water for like 10 mins, but it really didn't do anything at all ,though it did gave me some Placebo that it's heated .
The entry time for my college is 9:30 AM , but I got there at like 9:40 AM , but fortunately they let me in.

For College , it was the same , First Period was of Dayal Sir, who just gave us his PDF and told us to write everything down from it, which in my opnion is better then disturbing the class, Because then we don't waste our time by writing mindlessely and we learn anything we want.
Then the Second Period was of Ravi Sir , Database again today, then Amit sir (boring), and finally Lab, I did my assignment in the Lab, Also Sonali helped me complete it , she solved like three questions and also made the Front Page, She really is a good friend. 
The Lunch was kind of embarrasing , when Ranjan Said, that he feels disgusted he sees someone , and Anshu said , Isko(me)?

Helped Rounak fill the TCS job application, I didn't fill it , because I really am not sure about it.

I setup my PyCharm IDE for the Langchaing learning Journey and got it up and running , read a lot of Langchain documentation . It all took me like 3 hours in total . I will use the Pomodoro from the next time.
