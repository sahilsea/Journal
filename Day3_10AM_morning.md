Today I woke up at 10 AM , got kind of good sleep , got some sunlight after like 3 days, very ergamatic to find something really good to learn , something that may change my life . There are two things currently in my mind that I can learn , Unity Game dev and Machine learning and I want to learn both but then I think how would I cover everything else that I need to cover.

My college sent a form, for selecting the optional subject for our 6th the final semester , the two subjects are , Web Tech and Data Mining , I really want to go with Data Mining but the thing that I am worried about is who would teach it, If it is taught by Dayal sir , which everyone knows is the worst teacher in the world , then it's a problem , anyways I have already filled it to Data Mining , let just hope that it's not him. Almost Everyone is choosing Web tech.

I procastinated all day, watched a lot of videos like Clash Royal, Food Videos, Software that will make my life much easier, searched for best movies of 2024 ,currently watching Rebel Ridge .

So that was it for today , see ya.
