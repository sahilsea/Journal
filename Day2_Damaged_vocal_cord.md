Well I woke up today not aware of my Damaged Vocal cord , I Came to know about it much later in the day , because I don't talk much at home, and now I somewhat know how a person who can't speak must feel. I am already afraid that for some day I won't be able to speak with my friends clearly, but I also know that I will recover , so that's relieving.

Today I also didn't do much , procastination all day .
    - Fall of Islam
    - Immigration Crisis
    - Different countries stats vids
    - A bit of Clash Royal
    - Different Open source software (syncthing)
    - Lots of Cheese videos
    - Camping 

So that was it for today.
