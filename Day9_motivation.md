Feeling really sleepy right now , started my day as usual (really frustrated from this Baba, was singing from 5 AM in the morning from his freaking nose, it's really frustrating man ). 
I was awake for like a hour , and then slept till 8 PM.

College went as usual, was more fun then I expected , I thought I would use my laptop during Lab , but it was discharged, so it went just chatting with friends about The upcoming exam of the CUET and NIMSET. and then Rina mam period(Accounting) , which is like the most fun class in the whole classes , In her period we really get to laugh how much ever we want to, she also teaches really good . After that It was break , went to ground with Brajesh , had a lot of fun talking with friends like Ranjan (funniest Guy), Kaushik(Sexy), Uttam(savage), Karan(Cute) and Anshu(Extrovert). Then Amit Sir(networking) Class , which feels like the most boring class , he just keep on yapping , won't listen a single word from us. And lastly Ravi Sir class(VB.NET) which is the most informative class in all the classes, learned about Creating and managing Databases in the VB.NET and that's it , college done, went to deposit the sixth sem fee (32000) and came back to my room.

I watched the explanation video of Midsommar movie, and man It was really an eye-opening video. It teaches how a cult works , and how religion is just a cult with just a lot of time added to it, what kind of people it really manipulate and how it does all this. Now I want to watch more videos like this .

Today I have a lot to motivation to learn and think about things , yesterday It was like opposit , I had no motivation at all . So Today I did lil bit of my assignment and Started learning the Langchain Framework. Thinking of building really cool applications with it.
