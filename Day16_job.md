Missed lots of days , had to do a lot for my 1 month Project and also Langchain .
Made the whole report of my project , my teammate Shreya had done half of it , so I only had to do half althought
it was 50 pages so , it took some time. Also edited Raunik's , Shratik's Girlfriend's and Sonali's Report (learned
a lot of pdf editing).
And then me and Abhay collaborated on Canva to complete a presentation . Man doing things together by collaborating is
really fun and much easier to do , also the outupt is just amazing.
So after that we celebrated Makar sakranti, which was cold .

Currently learning the Langchain Framework , to create AI agents for my website and for cool projects, so far made
a chatbot using genai API, and Linkedin Profile summarizer using the ProxyAPI, Really amazing tools.

I am really in hurry to get a Job or even a internship , so I reached out to my connections (relatives) and they
said not to worry . He asked which field , I said Web Tech, so he said for that you must know tech like node.js and
react. I have learnt Python and Flask and many more libraries inside it but not so much of the javascript.

Learned about professional networking , learned that it is as important as learning to program. So now I staying
active on linkedin by posting , commenting and reaching out to different professionals.
Posting about my current activities , struggle , steps, thing i am learning and more to grow and connect to my
linkedin connections.
Also watched a video on how to use linkedin to get hired , it was worth every second of the hour.
