Came back from home to Danapur , to my flat . Really worried about what job would I do , because my college is about to be over in like five months , and now I really want to earn some money to support myself , because studying in college is I think a waste of time . I need to get hands on experience to really learn . Yeah, college makes my patience grow or in control but other then that I really can't get anything else. So I am thinking That job should be the thing that , I must do.

Anyways, I missed my seventh day, this is second time that I have missed my day, and all that because of the movie addiction , the thing is that when I watch one movie or series , then I just can't stop watching them at all , specially when I get stressed about everything like Going to college and doing hard work , after the comfert of my home and nice coushy bed. I finish one and then get to another and then another and the cycle continues . Once I am in , I just can't get out , out of that comfert zone , It feels impossible to break out of . Because once I get in , I am like in another world , I feel like I start to exist in that movie and specially the series.

Today's morning I watched a video on how to break out of middle class to the upper class, and the answer really just was , by "Thinking" , If you look back into the history of any successful person , then you would find that how crucial thinking is to become successful, and it is the unique thinking that made them , what they are today. 
And so If you really wanna be successful in your life , you must start thinking and also start working on those ideas . It is these ideas that will really get you what you want , stop learning by tutorial and start learning by doing about the ideas that you think. Because Doing is what makes you really think deeply , if you think that you can do all this just by thinking normally , then that really won't get you far. to really start Thinking deeply , you must start doing it.
Procastination is the biggest enemy of a thinker , It kills your thinking , by just giving you all thought out content all day. So you must also stop your procastination thing, so that you can think.
And if you build a business around that , then you even might not have to get a job , you might start earning on your own income and even grow bigger.
