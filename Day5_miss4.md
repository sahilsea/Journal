I miss my Day 4 because of these tv series , the thing is that once I start watching these movies or series , I just want to keep on watching , I started small , I thought I just watch a small movie , just to kill my time and after that one movie I am hooked to watch more.

So that's what I am doing watching movies and series all days , and that's how my days are going.

I recovered from my really scary cold , it was so bad that I could not even speak , I was coughing all night , so much that my abs started hurting, My throat was blown from the inside , at a point I really that I lost my voice.

My college is starting from tommorrow , I really need to go because of my attandence , but I just want to stay here and watch just one more.
